    "# Model Geometry Construction using Python \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of CE 5304 - Advanced Design of Structural Systems - at The University of Texas at El Paso, I have encouraged my students to think about constructing structural model geometry programmatically. The purpose of this Notebook is to help support that initiative with an interactive example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Construction Considerations and Commonalities \n",
    "\n",
    "Every structural model is built on several key aspects, which are software agnostic. These include:\n",
    "+ Geometry\n",
    "+ Material Properties\n",
    "+ Section Properties\n",
    "+ Connectivity\n",
    "+ Boundary Conditions\n",
    "+ Loads\n",
    "\n",
    "While this list is not exhaustive, these core components are critical to every model build, and are generally the drivers behind modeling errors. Currently we are just looking at the top three. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why build geometry programmatically?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous reasons to automate as much of your model construction as possible. They include:\n",
    "+ It is faster\n",
    "+ You are far less likely to make errors\n",
    "+ It is much easier to make changes\n",
    "+ It creates a logical backbone to your model construction that can be leveraged throughout the process\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start we need to initialize a few packages that we will use. "

We are generating nodes on the base floor that will not have members associated with them. These can be ignored or manually removed later. Also note that we are numbering non-consecutively, meaning that if a software requires consecutive numbering, it may have to be redone later, or a different approach should be adopted. "
